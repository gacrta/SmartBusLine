# SmartBusLine
A Genetic Algorithm solution to Buses on USP Butantã Campus

There are two circular bus lines at University of São Paulo and they are essential for the transportation of more than 50,000 people between Butantã Subway Station and USP Campus. They also have issues such as high travel time, high loading at peak times and low predictability.

To remedy these problems, we developded SmartBusLine. A system that generates alternative bus routes and classify them based on parameters such travel time, distance and others. This is achieved through Genetic Algorithm fed with a collection of user's origin and destination geographic points.

This work was inspired by "CHAKROBORTY, P., Genetic algorithms for optimal urban transit network design" research paper and was submited as Undergraduate Thesis for Electrical Engineering bachelor degree.
